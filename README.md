# PandoryDX Assetfile Repack Scripts

This repository contains utility files that use Mengxipeng's Asset Packer to modify the stock Pandora Box DX 
had, hadc and rade zip files so that they allow the Pandora to execute scripts from external storage.

Use these on your own stock firmware to create your own.

Usage: 
Put your firmware in the `original` folder and run

`./repack.sh`
